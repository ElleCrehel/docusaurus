# Introduction

SAP PPM (short for [SAP Enterprise Portfolio and Project Management](https://www.sap.com/products/scm/project-portfolio-management.html)) is the project module of SAP, available for SAP ECC and S/4 HANA On Premise and Private Cloud systems. It is, as we like to express it, the 'backbone' of our solution. The implemention of PPM is required on existing SAP systems (not S/4 HANA Public Cloud).

As part of the FRMP solution, we provide you with the neccesssary information to successfully prepare PPM before running our FRMP apps.
