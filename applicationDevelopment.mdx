# General

When developing a custom application for HER-apps some guidelines need to be followed. This to make sure all applications have the same look and feel.
Next to that it is also important that any developer can understand the code and make changes to it when needed.

To develop a new application an generator exists. The generator can be found [here](https://flexso.gitlab.host/flexso/flexso/flexso-research-management-package/appgenerator) and a quick how to is provided in the readme of the repo.
This generator will provide you with a **FRMP Application**, and your new application will be up an running in no time!

# Development guidelines

Always keep the fiori guidelines in mind when developping an application.

## 1. Master Page

When developping a master detail app, use a Smart Table, preferably based on SADL service.

## 2. Detail Page

Use Simple Form to format the layout of the different fields.

## 3. Use features

Features are fetched from the featureflags library and loaded into the "appView" model in Component.ts.

Use features in xml:

```xml
<YourControl visible="{= ${appView>/features/<<featureKey>>} ? !!${appView>/features/<<featureKey>>/featureCheck} : false}" />
```

Use features in a controller:

```typescript
const features = this.getFeatures();
```

# Deploy information

If you want to perform a FULL deploy of this application (with xsuaa, destination, ...) run the following npm script followed by the environment (dev or demo):

```bash
npm run deploy:{environment}
```

If the application was already deployed, for example by the FRMP package deployer, and you want to deploy only an update of the app its static content, run the following npm script followed by the environment (dev or demo):

```bash
npm run update:{environment}
```
