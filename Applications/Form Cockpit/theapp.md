## Form Overview

A form is made for a specific point in the lifecycle (phase and step) of an item / research project (defined by a funder, program and call). This is further split up by the role of the user accessing the item (for example a principal investigator will have different options than a team member).

A form can exist for multiple combinations but not vice versa.

&nbsp;

The Form Cockpit provides an overview of all created forms. Different filters are provided so a form can be found easily. You can filter on the description of a form as well as on the call saved in a combination.
