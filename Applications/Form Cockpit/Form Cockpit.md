## Form Cockpit

The Form Cockpit gives an overview of all existing forms. For each of these forms different combinations can be added. A combination contains at least a Funder, Program and Call. A Phase, Step and Role can also be added. 

From the Form Cockpit you can also create, copy, edit or delete a form.
