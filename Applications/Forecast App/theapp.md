# Forecast

Financial forecasting involves predicting future financial outcomes based on historical data, market trends, and various assumptions. It helps businesses anticipate cash flow, revenue, and expenses to make informed decisions and set achievable goals. By analyzing past performance and projecting future scenarios, financial forecasting assists in budgeting, strategic planning, and risk management.

The Forecast app empowers its users to generate accurate forecasts by integrating financial data, team member information, work package structures, and funder details. Users can conduct scenario analysis, validate forecasts, and visualize results to make informed decisions and optimize project resource allocation. With its intuitive interface and robust analysis capabilities, the app serves as a comprehensive tool for both internal project planning and external stakeholder communication.

Users can choose between internal forecasts for strategic planning and resource allocation within the organization, or external forecasts tailored for presenting financial projections to external stakeholders such as investors, clients, or regulatory bodies. This flexibility allows users to customize the forecast outputs based on the intended audience and objectives of the forecasting process.

The cut-off date in the financial forecast app serves as a pivotal reference point for determining historical financial data and calculations. It enables the application to accurately capture past performance by retrieving actual financial figures up to that date and calculating year-to-date budget and actuals. This ensures that the forecast generated from the cut-off date onward incorporates relevant historical context, providing a more informed basis for projecting future financial outcomes.
