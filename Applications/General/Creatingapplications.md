Since FRMP is deployed on BTP, is it also possible to create your own applications. This, for example, to meet certain extra business requirements of the customer. Besided the standard Fiori Guidelines, we created [additional FRMP (technical) guidelines](https://flexso.pages.flexso.gitlab.host/flexso/flexso-research-management-package/TheLibrarian/documentation/docs/Implementation/applicationDevelopment) that help you to match the look and feel of your own application to the FRMP applications.
