# Create Line Item

The "Create Line Item" feature in the Eligibility app empowers users to generate new eligibility items, each containing its own financial actual data. Users must input a posting date, actual amount, cost element, work package, and document header text for the new item. Once created, this item is seamlessly reflected across all applicable funders, ensuring consistency and accuracy in tracking financial data within the app.
