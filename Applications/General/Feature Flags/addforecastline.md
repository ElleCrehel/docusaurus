# Add Forecast Line

The "Add Forecast Line" feature enables users to manually input additional forecast data into a selected forecast version. For internal forecasts, this involves saving the data correctly into SAP PPM tables, ensuring integration with project management functionalities. In contrast, for external forecasts, the data is directly managed within custom /FLEX/ tables, simplifying the process and maintaining flexibility for external stakeholders.
