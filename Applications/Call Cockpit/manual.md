# User Guide

To support you with the app, we created a [user guide](https://cronos.sharepoint.com/:w:/t/flexso/projects/EaTTyHG4IHFMmHnC_pdz1gwB4Rv8JTu-HmJCbwtQ_yy5vQ?e=W8P61O).

## General

The call cockpit lists all the calls and provides additional information for each call. The call cockpit is the starting point to create a new item (= application or project).

Each call has a status. Depending on this status, and the fact if an applicable form is available (see form cockpit), it is possible for the end user to start a new item for the call.

Status:  
- ![image.png](./img/checkmark.png) The call is active. If an applicable form is available, you can create new items for this call.
- ![image.png](./img/warning.png) The call is not active. It is not possible to create new items for this call. Please contact your administrator for additional information.
- ![image.png](./img/formok.png) A form is available to create a new item for this call.

In the item app, all the information on item level is maintained. The available information is based on the forms created.

## Create an item
1.	Open the Call Cockpit.
2.	Select the call for which you want to create an item.
- By clicking on the line of the call, a side bar with additional information opens. From here, you can click through to create an item by clicking ![image.png](./img/create.png)
- By clicking ![image.png](./img/formok.png) on the line of the call, you are directly navigated.
3.	The item app, with the applicable form, opens. Complete the fields in the form and click   to create the new item.
4.	The item app stays open. Continue to edit fields, push to item to a next status by clicking ![image.png](./img/submit.png), continue to add project information by navigating to other project-related apps by clicking ![image.png](./img/relatedapps.png) or navigate back to the call cockpit by clicking the back-icon or to the launchpad by clicking the home-icon.
