# Extensibility

## Smart Table on Call Overview Page

The smart table can be extended with custom fields. Please contact your technical team if this is a requirement. Once the technical team has made the fields available, they can be added to the smart table.

## Extend Call Detail Page

The app can be extended with custom fields. Please contact your technical team if this is a requirement. Once the technical team has made the fields available, a key user can add those fields to the app by using the [Adapt UI functionality](../General/adaptUI.md).

## (In)active Calls

Custom logic can be implemented to make calls appear active or inactive in the Call Cockpit. For example (standard FRMP implementation, delivered with the package):

-	The publication date is in the past 
-	The submission deadline is in the future
